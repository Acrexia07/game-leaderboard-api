## üß™ Testing

### System Tests (Java)
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn clean test
```
#### Test Types:
- Unit Tests - Service layer business logic (JUnit 5 + Mockito)
- Slice Tests - Controller endpoints with MockMvc
- Security Tests - Authentication and authorization flows
- Repository Tests - Data access layer integration

### API Tests (Postman)
Postman Collection: [Game Leaderboard API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/46122428/2sB3QKtAqM)

#### Test Categories:
- **üîê Authentication** - Login, registration
- **üë• User Management** - CRUD operations, role-based access
- **üéÆ Player Management** - Profile operations, validation rules, token validation
- **üèÜ Leaderboard** - Rankings accuracy, data integrity
- **‚ùå Account Viewer** - All accounts, specific accounts, leaderboard view


#### Test Instruction (Test All Request)

```
**Take Note:** Ensure that the program and the database is connected before conducting testing.
```

1) Run `Positive(Create): Login - Base admin user` request.
   **Location:** Authentication > Login: Authenticated user

2) Run `Delete(Admin): Clean up all users` request twice.
   **Location:** Utilities

3) Run `Game Leaderboard API` collections.
